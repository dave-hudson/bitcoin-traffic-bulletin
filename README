bitcoin_traffic_bulletin

This software was designed to build and compile on Ubuntu 14.04 using gcc
4.7.x.  It ought to be able to run on lots of other typtes of systems, but
no attempt has been made (or will be made by the author) to do so :-)

The code is freely available under an MIT-like license.

It's written in C.


Cheers,
